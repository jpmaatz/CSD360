       <p> Interesting Life Lesson Event </p>

       <p> I have always kind of been into mischief in my life. I have usually used common sense to avoid funny situations but things can always happen even with careful planning. <span id = "LifeEvent"> _________
</span>, for example I had a pair of handcuffs as a kid and found them while going through my old room as a kid. 
</p>

       <p> My mother, ever the trusting soul that she is allowed me to put one handcuff on her and one on myself.<span id = "playing with handcuffs">
______________________________ </span> the thought being I had brought the key with me when we went visiting over to a cousin's house.
Turns out I had forgotten the keys at home. Being as we drove to the house together in my car made for a very comical situation of me trying to drive a manual shift while handcuffed</p>

       <p> After a very stressful driving experience we arrived back home and climbed the stairs carefully. We had never been so thrilled in our life to have been freed from the cuffs. <span
id="Lessons"> __________________ </span> The lesson learned is to never assume something without verifying it. A week later I opted put a Mentos candy into a bottle of Coke <span id = "Again"> ______________ The subsequent blast of soda showed my wisdom. </p>
